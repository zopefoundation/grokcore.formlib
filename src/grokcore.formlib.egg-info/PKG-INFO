Description: This package provides support for writing forms using the Zope Formlib
        library and registering them directly in Python (without ZCML).

        Setting up ``grokcore.formlib``
        ===============================
        
        This package is essentially set up like the `grokcore.component`_
        package, please refer to its documentation for details.  The
        additional ZCML lines you will need are::
        
          <include package="grokcore.formlib" file="meta.zcml" />
          <include package="grokcore.formlib" />
        
        Put the first line somewhere near the top of your root ZCML file.
        
        Examples
        ========
        
        We need an example interface::
        
          from zope import interface, schema
        
          class IMammoth(interface.Interface):
        
             name = schema.TextLine(title=u"Name")
             age = schema.Int(title=u"Age", min=0)
        
        Edit forms
        ----------
        
        You can provide an edit form for ``IMammoth`` like this::
        
        
          from grokcore import formlib
        
          class Edit(formlib.EditForm):
        
             formlib.context(IMammoth)
        
        
        If your content object is defined in the same Python file and
        implements ``grokcore.formlib.IContext``, then it will be the default
        context for your form.
        
        
        Display forms
        -------------
        
        Display forms are as easy as edit forms::
        
          class Index(formlib.DisplayForm):
        
             formlib.context(IMammoth)
        
        
        Generic forms
        -------------
        
        
        You can build more generic forms, providing your own actions for a form::
        
        
           class ISearch(interface.Interface):
        
               search = schema.TextLine(title=u"Text")
        
        
        After this, you define your form. It's applied to a mammoth, but uses
        the ``ISearch`` interface to generate fields::
        
           class Search(formlib.Form):
        
               formlib.context(IMammoth)
        
               form_fields = formlib.Fields(ISearch)
        
               def update(self):
                   # Default search results are None
                   self.search_result = None
        
               @formlib.action(u"Search")
               def search(self, text):
                   self.search_result = 'something found with text'
        
        
        
        Create a custom template ``search.pt`` to render your form (in a
        directory ``modulename_templates``).
        
        
        Add forms
        ---------
        
        Add forms work like generic forms, you have to provide your action
        ``Add``.
        
        Customization
        -------------
        
        Since a Grok form is a Grok view, all configuration directives and
        attributes available on a Grok view are available as well on a Grok
        form.
        
        This means that you can customize your form by associating a template
        with it. The template is responsible for displaying widgets and
        actions. The API to access them is the same as on a Zope Formlib form.
        
        You can't customize a form by providing a ``render()`` method on it,
        but you can still use the ``update()`` method if you want.
        
        Please refer to the documentation of `grokcore.view`_ for more
        details.
        
        API Overview
        ============
        
        Base classes
        ------------
        
        ``EditForm``
          Extends ``Form`` to create an edit form for your content.
        
        ``DisplayForm``
          Creates simple display forms.
        
        ``Form``
          Is a base class to create generic forms.
        
        ``AddForm``
          Extends ``Form`` to create add forms. You have to provide the *add*
          action which is going to create the new object.
        
        
        
        Decorators
        ----------
        
        ``action``
          Is a decorator to create an action on the form. Your action only has
          to accept values from the form as parameters.
        
        Helpers
        -------
        
        ``AutoFields``
          Create form fields from the given context. If the context is an
          interface, Zope fields defined in that interface are going to be
          used to build form fields.
          If the context is a regular object, Zope fields of all implemented
          interfaces of that object are going to used to build form fields.
        
        ``Fields``
          Create and reorder fields on the form.
        
        
        Additionally, the ``grokcore.formlib`` package exposes the
        `grokcore.component`_, `grokcore.security`_ and `grokcore.view`_ APIs.

        Changes
        =======
        
        1.10 (unreleased)
        -----------------
        
        - Nothing changed yet.
        
        
        1.9 (2012-05-01)
        ----------------
        
        - Nothing changed yet.
        
        
        1.8 (2010-11-03)
        ----------------
        
        - The context directive now has its own default computation.
        
        1.7 (2010-11-01)
        ----------------
        
        - Update version requirements for martian, grokcore.component, grokcore.security
          grokcore.view.
        
        1.6 (2010-10-18)
        ----------------
        
        - Made package comply to zope.org repository policy.
        
        - Update functional tests to zope.app.wsgi Browser instead of zope.app.testing
          one.
        
        - Don't depend anymore on zope.app.zcmlfiles for tests.
        
        1.5 (2009-12-13)
        ----------------
        
        - Use zope.container instead of zope.app.container (in tests and in the
          configure.zcml).
        
        - Fixed up missing dependencies and splitted regular and test dependencies.
        
        
        1.4 (2009-09-17)
        ----------------
        
        * Reflect the changes in ``grokcore.view`` 1.12 where ``View`` and ``CodeView``
          become a single ``View`` again. This reverts to the View situation of
          ``grokcore.formlib`` 1.1.
        
        1.3 (2009-09-16)
        ----------------
        
        * Remove the reference to the grok.View permission that is no longer in
          grokcore.security 1.2
        
        * Use 1.0b1 versions.cfg in Grok's release info instead of a local
          copy; a local copy for all grokcore packages is just too hard to
          maintain.
        
        
        1.2 (2009-07-20)
        ----------------
        
        * Adapted tests to the grokcore.view split of View and CodeView.
        
        * Fixed forms to use self.template.render() directly instead of using a
          removed private method from grokcore.view.
        
        * Add grok.View permissions for functional tests.
        
        1.1 (2009-01-07)
        ----------------
        
        * Have GrokForm define an empty actions attribute by default, in order
          for "action-less" forms to work easily.
        
        1.0 (2008-09-25)
        ----------------
        
        * Created ``grokcore.formlib`` in July 2008 by factoring
          ``zope.formlib``-based components, grokkers and directives out of
          Grok.
